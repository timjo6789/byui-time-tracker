# byui-time-tracker
Simple time tracker (Work in Progress)

# End goal

Easy time tracking program that tracks how long you spent and how long you should spend per credits. It has a class editor so that you can create new classes and determine its difficulty per class. It is calculated automatically but can be overridden.

# Currently
You can now easily track time with this project. However export to sheets is currently under development. 

# Warning
Data may be lost as it is stored locally on the web.
To backup your data, simply go to console and type in JSON.stringify(data) or JSON.stringify(load()) then just save it to file.
I will develop a better way to deal with this.
